  <p>Welcome to Fat Man's Fantasy League!</p>
  <p>Established in 2013, Fat Man's Fantasy has been uniting fantasy football enthusiasts for over a decade. What began as an 8-person league has now blossomed into a thriving community of 14 dedicated managers.</p>
  <p>In our 11th year, the competition has grown fiercer, with each manager vying for the coveted bragging rights and the chance to have their name immortalized on our league trophy. The ultimate goal? Avoiding the dreaded "Sacko" title, which comes with its own unique set of challenges.</p>
